CPRG 218 Intermediate Web Communications Assignment - Final Project

You have been hired by the Shangri-La beach resort to build them a new website using all the design and development skills you've learned. Attached to this assignment are a series of screenshots of their old website. These should not be duplicated: they have been provided  to show you how a site like this could appear. Your job is to create something unique and new (and ideally, better) than the old website. 
The full instructions for this assignment can be found in Brightspace.
